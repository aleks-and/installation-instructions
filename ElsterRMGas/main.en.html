        Mount the cable on the meter body and fix it. Important! The counter's pulse output can be designed in different designs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The meter can be sealed. Thus, it is impossible to replace the cable from the pulse output without removing the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connect the plug of the cable to the mating connector of the radio module and fix it. After connecting the radio module generates the event “Activation” and sends it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hold the magnet closer to its body against the specially marked area for at least a few seconds (area is located in the bottom central part of the radio module body).
    </p>
    <p>
        While there is the magnetic influence, the radio module will transmit it’s current value of the pulse counter to all ports.
